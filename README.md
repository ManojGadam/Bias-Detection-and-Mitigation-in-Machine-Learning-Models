Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as
"Census Income" dataset, this dataset contains information about adults from
various backgrounds and demographics. The task is to build a predictive model
that can classify whether an adult's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on
features such as age, education, occupation, etc. This binary classification
problem is important for understanding the factors that contribute to higher
incomes and can be used in social and economic research.

Description:
The Adult Income Dataset comprises a collection of demographic and socioeconomic
attributes of individuals, along with their corresponding income levels.
The dataset includes both categorical and numerical features, offering a
comprehensive view of various factors that may influence an individual's earning
potential.
Key attributes in the dataset include:
Age: The age of the individual.
Workclass: The type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Localgov,
etc.).
Education: The highest level of education attained by the individual.
Education-num: The numerical representation of education level.
Marital-status: The marital status of the individual (e.g., Married-civ-spouse,
Never-married, Divorced, etc.).
Occupation: The type of occupation held by the individual.
Relationship: The relationship status of the individual in the family.
Race: The race of the individual.
Sex: The gender of the individual.
Capital-gain: Capital gains recorded by the individual.
Capital-loss: Capital losses recorded by the individual.
Hours-per-week: The average number of hours worked per week.
Native-country: The country of origin of the individual.

The target variable to predict is the income level, which is categorized into two
classes: <=50K and >50K, indicating whether an individual earns less than or
more than $50,000 annually.
The task involves preprocessing the data, handling missing values, encoding
categorical variables, and developing a machine learning model capable of
accurately predicting income levels based on the provided features. Evaluation
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be utilized to assess
the performance of the model.
